This is my project on the statistical topic of random walks that I completed in my 2023 spring quarter at the 
University of Washington in the UW Statistics Directed Reading Program.

Elements of this repository:
- My R Code depicting random walks and testing convergence
- My Google Slides presentation on random walks
- My preliminary LaTex document with my findings
